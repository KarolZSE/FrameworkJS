# Fight the frameworks
Come and fight with framework monsters, beasts with the shape of a frameworks,
they will ask you a lot of questions and you better answer or be destroyed!

# Gameplay
At first you can move through the caves using WASD on your keyboard.
- You can mine using your left click on the stone walls.

- On the edges of the cave you can encounter a door - it always leads to a new room in the dungeon, going through it gives you a single potion and makes the enemies stronger, but remember after going through a door you cannot come back to the room before.

- You can earn armor and weapons by opening chests, which you can randomly encounter along the dungeon, to wear a new piece you have to right click on its icon in the inventory.

- While you can't see them, they can see you. I'm talking about framework monsters, when you encounter them they will always initiate a fight:
- Their level will depend on how deep inside the cave you are.
- In case of a fight you will always be the first to start, you can: **Attack, heavy attack or heal**:
- By attacking you deal damage to the monster (the damage is affected by your luck, weapons rarity and level)
- By heavy attacking you use one turn for preparation and on the next you can click heavy attack to hit the enemy with triple the force.
- By healing you use one of your potions (which you get by going through doors) to regain a big part of your hp.
- whenever your action is the next thing that will happen is the enemy's turn, when it attacks you can block the damage by identifying the framework snippet it throws at you (but if you fail you get hit by the full damage of the attack).
- You win if your opponent's HP hits 0.
- You lose if your hp drops to 0.
